MIPS-Processor
==============

The project is to build a MIPS micro-processor, which is composed of registers, ALUs, finite state  machines, memories, and other logic building blocks. The microarchitecture can be separated into two parts: the datapath and the control. The datapath  contains structures such as memories, registers, ALUs, and multiplexers. The control unit receives the  current instruction from the datapath and tells the datapath how to execute that instruction.
